# React-Slider-Greyscale Infinite with Minimalism

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## To start the project:

1. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install

2. Run the development server:
    ```sh
   npm run dev

The slider works when scrolling with the mouse wheel:
- Smooth animation is present when scrolling with the wheel on yourself
- Scrolling without animation works when scrolling with the wheel away from you
